The Third Rail API is part of the SMARTA project - a collection of tools and services built around
[MARTA APIs](http://www.itsmarta.com/app-developer-resources.aspx) supplemented
with analysis of historic patterns, static schedule data, and external sources like Twitter.

## Project Maturity

SMARTA is _very_ young. Young, scrappy, and hungry. ðŸ˜Ž

## Prerequisites

You will need a [MARTA API key](https://www.itsmarta.com/developer-reg-rtt.aspx)
to fetch the live results from MARTA's base API. For Twitter interactions you will
need a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) 
and an API client and secret. 

To build and run Third Rail as a container you will need Docker.
